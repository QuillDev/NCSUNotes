# CH101 Notes 2021-10-08
- Difference between electronegativities >= 1 = polar bond
- Example Oxygen (3.5) and Carbon (2.5) form a polar bond with oxygen having the higher electronegativity
- Dispersion force interactions scale based on the size of the molecule
- Attraction between ions and dipoles depends on __ion charge__ and __ion-diple distance__ (coulumbs law)
- 760mmHg = 1atm
