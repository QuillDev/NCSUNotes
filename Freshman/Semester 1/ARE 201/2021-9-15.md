## Unit 7 - Price floor and Price Ceiling
- At equilibrium we reach efficient allocation and max total surplus (consumer surplus, producer surplus)
### Price Control
- Price ceiling: a maximum price sellers are allowed to charge for a good or service. (usually set below equilibrium)
    - Example: Rent Control
- Price Floor: a minimum price buyers are required to pay for a good or service (usually set above equilibrium)
    - Minimum Wages
- When there is no price control we can get the (natural?) equilibrium point.
- If the price control is not going to effect the equilibrium (price ceiling above the equilirbium point or price floor below the equilibrium point) it is considered NON BINDING meaning it has no effect on the market outcome. Otherwise it is binding.
- Deadweight loss: corresponds to the amount of efficiency lost by a price ceiling/floor
- When there is a price ceiling, quantity supplied decreases (less suppliers able to make/profit off of goods for the selling price), the price ceiling also increases the quantity demanded which leads to a shortage in goods.
### How price floor causes inefficiancy
- Wasted resources
- Inefficiently high quality
- inefficient allocation of sales among sellers
- temptation to break the law by selling below the minimum price
- price floors misallocate sales by
    - Allowing high-cost firms to operate
    - May prevent low-cost firms from entering the industry
    - Encourages waste
- inefficiently high quality
    - causes manufacturers to create higher quality products but have to raise thier price
    - Consumers get higher quality products but would prefer a lower price.
- Illegal Activity
    - Price forge encourage black markets
- So why are there price floors
    - Some people do benefit from price floors
    - If a price floor is longstanding buyers may not have a realistic idea of what would happen without it.
    - Government officials often do not understand supply and demand
- __All controls create deadweight loss__
