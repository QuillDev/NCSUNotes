## Definitions
- Molar mass describes both formula mass and atomic mass
### Types of Atom Groups
- Elements: One or more atoms of the same type
- Molecule:  two or more atoms together
- Compounds:  two or more atoms of differing types together.

## Conversions
### Converting between mols and grams 
- Mols -> Grams = x by atomic or molar mass
    - First calculate the mass of CO<sub>2</sub> (44.g/mol)
    - Now use the molar mass as a conversion factor between mold and grams
    - 0.50mol CO<sub>2</sub> * 44.g = 22.g CO<sub>2</sub>
### Converting between moles and grams
- First calculate the molar mass of the element (Ex. H<sub>2</sub>0 15g/18.gmol) = 0.83 mol
### Examples
- Using C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
- Atomic mass = (12 * 6) + (H * 12) + (16 * 6)
- .01 mol -> Grams = .01 * Atomic mass
- Molecules = .01mol * 6.022x10<sup>23</sup>

## Balancing Chemical Equations
- Base: Cl<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -> Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
- Balanced: 2Cl<sub>2</sub> + 7O<sub>2</sub> -> 2Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
- Never alter subscripts

## Atoms... Again.
- All atoms of the same species have the same amount of protons
- Atoms can have differing amounts of electrons and neutrons while remaining the same element
- Atoms with differing numbers of neutrons are isotopes
- Atoms with differing numbers of electrons are ions.
- The atomic mass of the element on the periodic table is an average of the most common isotopes.
