# Grand Challenge Individual Brainstorming

## Securing the Cyberspace
- Currently data leaks are rampant
- Weakness in infrastructure (See pipe line attacks etc)
- More security allows greater assurance of data privacy.
- Attacks on the cyber space can currently have disastrous effects on Infrstructure.
### Target Groups
- Wealthier Nations/Groups as they have increased access to these technologies (US/Japan/China), Also effects smaller nations governments
## Providing Access to Clean Water
- Unclean water is disease (Water Born Illness)
- Typcially caused by limited infrastructure (Poorer Nations)
- Unclean water may also have side effects such as lead poisoning
- Caused by lack of sanitary disposal etc near water sources.
### Target Groups
- Poorer Nations and some Rural locations in wealtier countries (Flint, Michigan for example)
## Enhance Virtual Reality
- Allows for treatment of common phobias (Fear of Heights, Agoraphobia etc)
- Helpful for simulations in things such as space flight etc.
- Allows for cheaper training in complex tasks and fields.
- Assuming physics are advanced enough would allow for an engineering "sandbox" where we can design without cost
### Target Groups
- Wealthier/More advanced nations but with cheaper technology all nations
