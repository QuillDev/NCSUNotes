## The PPF and comparative advantage
- How expensive a goo a country decides to produce depends on how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from another country.
- Countries tend to have different costs of producing goods due to different geography etc.
- Comparative Advantage: When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country.
## Absolute and Comparative Advantage
- When a country can use less resources to produce a good than another country that's an **Absolute Advantage**
- When a country can produce a good at a lower opportuniy cost it is called a **relative** advantage.
## Gains in Trade
- A country that can consume more than it can produces as a result fo specialization and trade.
- Trade allows a company to extend it's consumption out of it's own PPF curve.
## What happens when a country has an absolute advantage in all goods?
- when one country has an absolute advantage in all goods and another country has an absolute disadvantage in all goods, both countries can still benefit.
- Gains on both sides lead to competitive advantage, and stimulate growth?
### Example Question
- Milly has the absolute advantage in y as she can produce 40 units to max's 20.
- Milly has the comparative advantage in y since she can produce 4 units of y to one unit of x.
- Max will be better off because he has a worse opportunity cost for y and neither of them have an absolute advantage in x.
