## Lecture #4
### Limiting Reactants
- whatever you run out of in the equation is the limiting reagent.
### Energy
- Sign of the energy determines the direction of the energy
- Energy is defined as the capacity to move something.
- Usually referring in a difference in energy between two 'things'
### Electromagnetism and Coulomb's Law
- When charged particles are brought together, they are either attracted or repelled from one another.
- F = (kq<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub>)/(er<sup>2</sup>)
- e = dialectric constant, a shielding factor (depends on solvent (what material it is))
- Attractive forces = F is negative
- Repuslive forces = F is positive
- The larger the charge the stronger the force in either direction (same repels, different attracts)
- Forming bonds releases energy, breaking bonds takes energy
## Lecture #4 - Chapter 2 - Quantum Theory
- The bohr model of the hydrogen atom, bohr introduced quantum theory into the atomic model. The electrons can circle the nucleus in orbits of only certain radii corresponding to specific energies.
