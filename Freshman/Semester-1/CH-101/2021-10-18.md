## Enthalpy
```ts
let direction = (Hf > Hi)
? Endothermic
: Exothermic
```

### Potentiol Energy Diagrams
- If no energy is required to make a reaction occur it is by nature exothermic it is also favorable
### Hess's Law
dH = SUM(dH[products])/-SUM(dH[reactants])
- dH = delta entrophy
### Determining dH via bond energies
- Values that are positiv are the amount of energy to break a bond (energy of dissociation)
- At state (elemental form) the dH of it is zero (O2 Cl2 etc...)
## Entrophy
- The measure of disorder in a system
- dS = S[final] - S[initial]
- ORDER = SOLID > LIQUID > GAS
- Favorable to move towards disorder - Favorable reactions have positive entrophy
- More gas = positive delta S
## Gibbs Free Energy
- A combination of heat and sisorder that can be used to predict the spontaneity of a reaction
- A spontaneous process is one that, once started, takes place without intervention
 - ``dG = dH - TdS``
 - If our gibbs free energy is less than zero it is favorable & spontaneous
 - If our gibbs free energy is greater than zero, it will not continue without work being done on it (considered less favorable)
## Kinetics - Activation Energy
- Thermodynamics only considers the starting and ending energies, not the path.
- Kinetics considers the rate and mechanism of the reaction.
### Reaction Rates
1. Frequency of Collisions
2. Fraction of successful collisions
    - Depends on orientation and Ea
### Rate Law
- Mathematic expression that descibres the rate of reaction
- The race constant (k) is a function of Ea and Thermal Energy k always increases with temperature.
- For a one-step process that rate law is as follows
     - Rf = kf[AB][C]
     - Rf is the rate for hte forward reaction
     - kf is the rate constant
     - [AB][C] is representative of the concentation of reactants for a real chemical formula
