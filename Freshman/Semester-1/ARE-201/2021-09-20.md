# ARE 201 - 9/20 - Price Elasticity
## Price elasticity of demand
- A demand is elastic, when an increase in price reduces the quantity demanded a lot 
- A demand is inelastic when an increase in price reduces the quanity demanded only a little.
- The most responsive quantity demanded is to a change in pric ethe most elastic is the demand curve.
- Elasticity is not equal to the slope
## Defining and Measuring Eslasticity
- Price elasticit of demand is -> 
- (%change in quantity demanded) / (% change in price)
- Normally drop the positive/negative on price elasticity of demand
## Calculating percent change
- Q -> q2-q1/q1
- P -> p2-p1/
## Elasticity vs Inelasticity
- Inelastic = Elasticity below 1
- Elastic = Elasticity above 1
- unit-elastic = Elasticity is one
- Total revenue does not change when we have unit elastic demand
- Price elasticity of demand changes along the demand curve
- If elasticity is less than 1 and there is an increase in price there will be an increase in total revenue
- If elasticity is less than 1 and there is an increase in price there will be a decrease in total revenue.
- Fewer substitutes makes it harder for consumers to adjust q when p changes, so demand is inelastic
- For necessities we do not change q mch when p changes
- Luxuries are more sensitive when P changes.
- We are more sensitive to price changes when the good feels expensive, and vice versa
