## Unit 3 - Supply and Demand
### Unit Overview
- Define competitive market
- illustrate how a compettive market is described by supply and demand curves
- Illustrate the difference between a movement along the supply and demand curve and a change in demand/supply.
- Identify the factors that shift the demands/supply curve.
- Illustrate how supply and demand curves determine a **market's equilibrium price**
- Draw a supply and demand graph, illsutrate how equilibrium price and quantity are affected when there is a change in either supply or demand.
### Markets and Competition
#### Perfectly Competitive Market
- Goods offered for sale are all exactly the same.
- Buyers and sellers are abundant
- No single buyer or seller has any influence over the market price --> *Price Takers*
### Demand, Supply and Equilibrium in Market for Goods and Services.
- **Demand**: the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price.
- **Price**: what a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service.
- **Quantity Demanded**: the total number of units of a good or service consumers are willing to purchase at a given price.
- **Law of Demand**: keeping all other variables that affect demand constant.
    - If price goes up, then quanitty demanded goes down
    - If price goes down, then quantity demanded goes up.

### Demand Schedule and Curve
- Demand Schedule: A table that shows a range of prices froa  certain good or service and the qauntity demanded at each price.
- Demand Curve: a graphic representaiton of the relationship between price quantity demanded of a certain good or service, with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price on the verical axis.
- The *downward slope* of the demand curve -> the law of demand
