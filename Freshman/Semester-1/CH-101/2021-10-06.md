## Chapter 7 - States of Matter and the Ideal Gas Law
### Properties of gasses
- Gasses occupy containers uniformly and completely
- Gas properties can be _modeled_ using math. ``PV=nRT``
### Simplified Ideal Gas Laws
- Units of temperature always in Kelvins (Celcius + 273)
#### Boyle's Law
- Volume inversely proportional to Pressure -> ``V=1/P``
- ``P1V1 = P2V2`` Can be used for calculating strictly changes in pressure or volume between two states.
#### Charles's Law
- ``V1/T1 = V2/T2`` Ratio of Volume:Temperature at one volume or temperature must equal the ratio of Volume to Temperature at another volume or temperature
