## Test next class in chem
- Will have equations
- Will have periodic table
- Will have needed polyatomic ions
## Bond Order
- Bond order is the number of shared pair between two atoms, or the number of bonds between two atoms
    - Single Bond: BO=1
    - Double Bond: BO=2
    - Triple Bond: BO=3
## Complex Lewis Structures
- Make sure that charged atoms have their charges reflected in the valence electron count
## Resonance Structures
- Resonance Structures only differ by the placment of the electrons
- Written in [] showing different states of the atom.
- Bond order is calculated over the total resonance stuctures to provide an average for all stuctures.
## Formal Charge
- electrons in free atom - electrons in bonded atom
- For example, carbon in CO (triple bond) is -1 FC = CHARGE - (FREE-ELECTRONS + BONDS)
- In this case that is (4 - (2 + 3)) = -1
- The best lewis structure is the one with the lowest formal charge
## Choosing the best Lewis Structure
- Minimize the formal charge on all the atoms
- minmize the distance between charges (charge separation takes energy)
- The negative formal charge resides on the more electro-negative atoms
- Sometimes formal charge cannot be avoided
