* - Do short answer quiz discussion (Ungraded - Do concisely)
- After doing discussion do short answer quiz
## Objectives
- Define scarcity, opportunity cost, specialization, and equilibrium.
- Explain how scaricty and choice are central to ecconomics.
- Explain what economics is, why is it important?
- Apply scarcity & opportunity cost concepts. (IRL)
- Understand differnces between macro and micro economics.

## Economics and Scarcity
- Economics is the study of how people make decisions in the face of scarcity
- People make choices on how to use resoucrces based on their own interests and incentives.

## Scarcity
- Scarcity = Result of unlimited wants and limited supply.
- Scarcity causes choices to be made.
## The division and specialization of labor.
- Specialization makes individual workers more productive since they don't have to do multiple tasks.
- Development of specialized tools further improve the efficiency of specialized workers.
- Trade produces the requirement for specialization to keep up with the throughput of produce.
### Division of labor
- The division of labor is splitting labor into discreet takss, it is the way in which tasks are divided to complete a task.
### Difference between division of labor and Specialization
- Specialization is an evolution in a sense of the division of labor since instead of just splititng tasks it divides them by tasks that people are more gifted/better in.
- Both improve throughput of prduct significantly.
- Specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, because with quantity needed the amount of price per individual product is reduced. (With more specialized people products increased is greater than possible before)
- Workers also learn to be more efficient.

## Micro and Macroeconomics.
- Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like housholds, workers and businesses.
- Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that focuess on broad issuse such as growth, unemployment, inflation, and trade balance.

## Economic Theories and Models
- A theory is a simple explaination of how two or more variables interact.
    - A good theory is simple enough to understand, while complex enough to capture key features.
- We will use the terms model and theory interchangabely.
### Circular Flow Diagram
- shows how households and firms interact in the goods and services, market, and in the labor market.
## How to organize economies
- Three traditional ways to organize economies
- Traditional Economies
- Command Economy
- Market Economy

### Traditional Economy
- Things are done the same way they have always been done.
    - Oldest economic system.
    - Occupations tend to stay in family.
    - What you produce is what you consume.
    - Little economic progress or development.
### Command Economy
- An economy where decisions are passed down from the government, government owns resources
    - Government decides everything, what, how, how much, etc
    - Government decides what methods of production to use and sets wages for workers
    - Currently North Korea
### Market Economy
- An economy where decisions are decentralized, and individuals own businesses, supply services, etc. Most things are decided within the market itself.
    - Interaction between buyers and sellers is basd on combination of supply and demand.
## Real World Economies
- Most ecnomies in the world are moxed, They combine elements of command, traditional, and market systems.
    - The United States is potitioned toward the market economy end of the spectrum.
    - Europe is mostly market economies with more government interferance than the United States.
    - Russia and China are closer to command ecnomies
## The rise of globalization
- The trend in which buying and selling markets have become more globalized.
- Exports: Goods/Services produced locally and sold abroad
- Imports: Goods and services are produces abroad and sold locally
- Without trade, individual cannot specialize and thus cannot obtain the benefits of specialization.

## The concept of opportunity cost.
- indicates what one must give up to obtain what he or she desires
    - The cost of one item in the lost opportunity to do or consume something else.
    - The value of the next best alternative foregone
    - Every choice has an opportunity cost.
    People should specialize in something that has a low opportunity cost.
- ``little note - just the value of the provided service/product versus the products/services that could be done in it's place.``
## The concept of Equilibrium
- **Equilibrium** an economic situation in which no individual would be better of doing something different.
- An ecnomy is efficient if it takes all opportunities to make some people better off without making other people worse off.
