## Unit 7 Review
- Intermolecular forces
    - Ion-Ion (Coulum's Law) 
    - Ion-dipole forces
    - Dipole-dipole forces
        - Special dipole dipole case : Hydrogen Bonds [FON]
    - Forces involving nonpular molecules: Included Forces

## Electronegativity Differences
- 0 -> 0.4 | Non-Polar
- > 0.4 -> 1.8 | Polar
If electronegativity difference is >0.4 and less than ~1.8 then it is polar
