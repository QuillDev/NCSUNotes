## Unit 3 - Supply and Demand
### Unit Overview
- Define competitive market
- illustrate how a compettive market is described by supply and demand curves
- Illustrate the difference between a movement along the supply and demand curve and a change in demand/supply.
- Identify the factors that shift the demands/supply curve.
- Illustrate how supply and demand curves determine a **market's equilibrium price**
- Draw a supply and demand graph, illsutrate how equilibrium price and quantity are affected when there is a change in either supply or demand.
### Markets and Competition
#### Perfectly Competitive Market
- Goods offered for sale are all exactly the same.
- Buyers and sellers are abundant
- No single buyer or seller has any influence over the market price --> *Price Takers*
### Demand, Supply and Equilibrium in Market for Goods and Services.
- **Demand**: the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price.
- **Price**: what a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service.
- **Quantity Demanded**: the total number of units of a good or service consumers are willing to purchase at a given price.
- **Law of Demand**: keeping all other variables that affect demand constant.
    - If price goes up, then quanitty demanded goes down
    - If price goes down, then quantity demanded goes up.

### Demand Schedule and Curve
- Demand Schedule: A table that shows a range of prices froa  certain good or service and the qauntity demanded at each price.
- Demand Curve: a graphic representaiton of the relationship between price quantity demanded of a certain good or service, with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price on the verical axis.
- The *downward slope* of the demand curve -> the law of demand
### Supply of goods and services
- Supply: the amount of some good or servicce a producer is willing to supply at each price
- Quantity Supplied: the total number of units of a good or service producers are willing to sell at a given price
- Law of supply: assuming all other varibales remain the same, as price goes up quantity supplied increases, as price goes down the quantity supplied decreases
### Supply Schedule and Curve
- Supply Schedule: a table that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices.
- Supply Curve:  a graphic illustration between price, shown on the vertical axis, and quantity shown on the horizontal axis.
- The upward slope of the supply curve illustrates the law of supply (as price increases, the more of that good will be supplied)
### Equilibrium - Where the supply and demand curves intersect
- **Equilibrium**: the combination of price and quantity where there is no economic prssure from suprluses or shortabges that would cause a price or quantity to change.
- - Quantity Demanded = Quantity Supplied
- **Equilibrium Price**: the price where quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied.
- **Equilibrium Quantity** the quantity at which quantity demanded and supplied are equal for a certain price level.
### Markets not in equilibrium
- Surplus (excess supply): occurs at any price above the equilibrium
- Shortage - when the price is below the equilibrium point. (cannot make enough products to meet up with demand for their product at the given price) - price increases until equilibrium is reached.
### Shifts in demand and supply for goods and services
- Ceteris Paribus: Latin phrase meaning other things beingn equal
- Any given supply and demand is baed on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal
### Movements vs Shifts
- Movements are different than shifts
- A shift in one curve never cuases a shift in the other curve, Rather than a shift, one curve causes a movement along the second curve.
### Demand Curve Shifters
- Income: normal goods v.s. inferior goods
- Changing tastes or preferences
- Changes in the composition of the population
- Price of related goods changes: substitutes v.s. complements 
- Changes in expectations about future.
### Shifting the demand curve
- consumers will pruchase larger quantities, pushing demand to the right.
- Thus causing the demand curve to shift right.
- increased demand means that at every given price the quantity demanded is higher so that the demand curve shifts to the right.
### Types of goods and services
- Normal good: A product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice versa.
- Inferior Good: A product whose demand falls when income rises, and vice versa Ex) pollution, garbage.
- Substitute: a good or service that we can use in place of another good or service.
- Complements: goods and services that are bound together (tuition and college, computer and software) (demands are bound, incWWrease in price of one leads to a decrease in demand for the other.)
- Demand of substitutes will decrease with the demand for another substitute in the same field increases.
