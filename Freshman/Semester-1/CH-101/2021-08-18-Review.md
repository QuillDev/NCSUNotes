## Atoms - Review
- Smallest distinct piece of matter, all matter built from atoms.
- isotopes have varying numbers of neutrons.

## The Mol & Avagadro (6.022*10^23)
- Mols are used to move the small units used in atomic chemistry to the SI scale (centimetres, etc.)
- Allows weighing atoms (raw materials) in order to get the amount of atoms (grams -> mols -> atoms)

# Polyatomic Ion
- Ion made up from multiple atoms
- Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> -> NO<sub>3</sub> is an example of a polyatomic
- Mols form in ratios, for example in 3 mols of 3H<sub>2</sub>0 we have 6 mols of hydrogen.
- For any compount, the formula mass i the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in it's checmical formula.
- EXAMPLE: H<sub>2</sub>0 has a mass of ~18g 
## Converting Between Mols and Grams
- Converting between mols and grams
- Sum the mass of 1 mol of the atom and multiply by the amount of mols to get the grabs (weight of 1 mol = atomic mass of molecule)
## Stoichiometry
- Stoichiometry is founded on the concept of the conservation of mass, which states that the amount of reactants and products will alaways remain the same.
- We also have the same quantity  of each type of molecule on either side of the equation.
CH<sub>4</sub> + 20<sub>2</sub> -> CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub> - in this example we show a balanced methane combustion reaction.
